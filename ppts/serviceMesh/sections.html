        <h2>Microservices</h2>
        <small>
            Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural
            style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
            In a microservices architecture, services should be fine-grained and the protocols
            should be lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller
            services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand,
            develop and test. It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams
            to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently.It also allows the
            architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.
            Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.

            Services in a microservice architecture (MSA)[4] are often processes that communicate
            with each other over a network in order to fulfill a goal using technology-agnostic
            protocols such as HTTP. However, services might also use other kinds of
            inter-process communication mechanisms such as shared memory.[9] Services might also
            run within the same process as, for example, OSGI bundles.
            Services in a microservice architecture should be independently deployable.[10]
            The services are easy to replace.
            Services are organized around capabilities, e.g., user interface front-end,
            recommendation, logistics, billing, etc.
            Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases,
            hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best.
            Services are small in size, messaging enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed,
            independently deployable, decentralized and built and released with automated processes.
